Tv Renamr provides a way for you to rename your tv show files. By default it looks at files in the format show.s0e00.foo.bar.avi 
or show.0x00.foo.bar.avi and renames them to: "Show - 103 - Foo Bar.avi".

Users can specify a number of options to manipulate the output filenames and where they would like the files moved to when named. 

Tv Renamr is an open source project written in Python and released under the MIT license. The source code can be found at
