TV Renamr is a utility to rename TV shows based upon filenames or user input.



===== Requirements =====
- Python 2.5+
- The Interwebs



===== How To Use =====
TV Renamr can be run with either the script or as a daemon (currently linux only)

=== Script ===
Run the script with python tvrenamr.py [options] file/folder

Options



=== Daemon ===
The daemon will watch the specified folder for new files to rename so you can drag and drop files into it.

Run it with python tvrenamrd.py [options] folder_to_watch

Options



=== Custom Regular Expressions ===
By default TV Renamr will match shows in the formats: show.s0e00 and show.0x00 but you can specify custom regular 
expressions if your files aren't in either of these formats. Some custom regular expression syntax has been used to help you
specify different parts of the filename:

Series: %n - (?P<series>[\w\s.,_-]+)
Season: %s - (?P<season>[\d]{1,2})
Episode: %e - (?P<episode>[\d]{2})

Note: All spaces are converted to periods before your regular expression is run
